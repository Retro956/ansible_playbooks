# Ansible Playbooks

The ansible playbooks here are going to be assorted playbooks 
that I use in my homelab environment.  This will include 
playbooks for the Raspberry Pi 4 cluster, plays to install 
needed packages, and even configure them via my dotfiles. 
I will probably be updating this periodically with more 
playbooks.

## How to use
For my dotfiles and configurations, step into the rpi_cluster 
directory and run "ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -K".  It will 
then ask you for your sudo password and off you go.  In the 
future, I will create a few README.md files for each project.
